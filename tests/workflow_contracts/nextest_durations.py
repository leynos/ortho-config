"""Reading a nextest duration as the runner reads one.

Separated from ``nextest_budgets`` so the grammar and the configuration

nextest deserializes every duration with ``humantime_serde``. That

#: One value-and-unit pair of a duration as ``humantime`` spells it.
#: nextest deserializes every duration with ``humantime_serde``, which
#: reads a sequence of such pairs and sums them, so ``"2h 37m"`` and
#: ``"1m30s"`` are configuration it accepts. A reader taking one pair
#: with one short unit refuses a file nextest loads, and the contract
#: then fails on a correct file and blames the file for it.
#:
#: The grammar was measured against humantime 2.3.0, which is what the
#: lockfile of the pinned cargo-nextest release resolves (the shared
#: coverage action this repository uses installs
#: ``cargo-nextest@0.9.120``), by compiling that parser and running the
#: cases through it. The fractional part is optional and humantime
#: tolerates whitespace around the point, so ``"1.5m"`` and
#: ``"1 . 5 m"`` are both ninety seconds. A leading point, a missing
#: fractional part, a second point, a sign and a digit separator are all
#: refused there, and so are refused here.

#: Rust's ``char::is_whitespace`` as a character-class body, written out
#: because Python's ``\s`` is not the same set. Measured over the whole of
#: Unicode: ``\s`` matches these twenty-five code points and also U+001C to
#: U+001F, the file, group, record and unit separators, which Rust rejects;
#: Rust matches nothing ``\s`` does not. A reader spelling its whitespace
#: ``\s`` therefore skips a separator wherever it skips a space, and reads
#: ``"1\x1cs"`` as one second from a configuration nextest refuses at
#: startup.
#:
#: This is the digit lesson at a second class. ``[0-9]`` is spelled out
#: below for the mirror-image reason: ``\d`` accepts Unicode digits Rust
#: refuses.

#: Digits with whitespace tolerated between them. humantime's parser
#: skips whitespace while it accumulates a number, so ``"1 0s"`` is ten
#: seconds rather than a malformed duration, and the same holds either
#: side of the point: ``"1 2 . 3 4 s"`` is 12.34 seconds.
#:
#: The class is ``[0-9]`` and not ``\d``, which is the whole of the
#: difference between the two parsers here. Python's ``\d`` matches
#: every Unicode decimal digit and ``int`` reads them, so ``"\u0663\u0660\u0660s"``
#: became three hundred seconds; humantime's parser compares against
#: ``'0'..='9'`` and refuses the text, at offset 0 when the run opens
#: with one and at the first such character otherwise. A reader wider
#: than the parser certifies a configuration nextest cannot load.

    humantime carries the running total as whole seconds beside a
    nanosecond remainder, and every product and sum between them is a
    checked ``u64``, so a total past either ceiling will not load even
    though each component did. Both ceilings are enforced here, in
    humantime's order.

    The remainder is bounded first, before any carry: ``add_current``
    opens with ``(out.subsec_nanos() as u64).add(nsec)?``, so the
    remainder held so far plus this component's nanoseconds must fit a
    ``u64`` by themselves. Two values of ``u64::MAX`` nanoseconds carry
    the first to 18,446,744,073 seconds and then overflow on the second.
    The duration they name, about 36.9 billion seconds, sits nowhere
    near the seconds ceiling, which is the point: a reader summing into
    Python's unbounded integer and checking only the seconds afterwards
    finds them comfortably in range and reports a duration for text
    nextest will not start under.

    The carry then happens at a complete second rather than past one.
    humantime's own ``add_current`` leaves exactly a billion in the
    remainder and hands it to ``Duration::new``, which carries it
    regardless and panics when the seconds then leave the ``u64``.
    Comparing with ``>`` alone reads ``"18446744073709551615s 1000ms"``
    as a duration one second past the ceiling, and nextest cannot load
    that text by either route. Carrying at a complete second keeps
    ``"0.5s 0.5s"`` a duration of one second, which humantime reads.

    Parameters
    ----------
    duration : str
        The duration text being read, named in any refusal.
    total : tuple[int, int]
