"""Contract tests for the CodeScene uploader's deprecated checksum inputs.

At ``a5765019`` the shared uploader's committed ``cli-manifest.json`` is the
trust anchor for the CLI archive, and the action *rejects* a non-empty
``installer-checksum`` with a hard failure rather than ignoring it. A workflow
that still passes the input therefore breaks its coverage step outright, and
the ``CODESCENE_CLI_SHA256`` repository variable that fed it could only ever
repeat the digest the manifest already pins.

Four separate concerns are asserted, each in its own test so a failure names
the defect rather than a bundle:

* no workflow passes ``installer-checksum``;
* no workflow references the ``CODESCENE_CLI_SHA256`` variable that fed it;
* every uploader reference is pinned to one approved full SHA;
* the dispatch workflow that refreshed the variable is absent.

Each test asserts over a collection that is checked for content first. A
contract that ranges over an empty collection is satisfied by deleting the
thing it guards, which is the failure mode these tests exist to avoid.

Run via ``make test-workflow-contracts``.
