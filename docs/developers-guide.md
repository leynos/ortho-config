# Developers guide

This guide documents how contributors work with tests in this repository. It
focuses on behavioural tests because they span multiple crates and have the
highest maintenance cost when patterns drift.

## Current testing strategy

The workspace runs one unified test workflow via Make targets:

- `make check-fmt`
- `make lint`
- `make test`

These are required quality gates for code changes. Behavioural coverage runs
inside the standard Rust test harness, not a bespoke test runner.

## Subcommand dispatch changes

Cargo's external-subcommand contract is an entry-point concern, not a
configuration-loading concern. When the way a `cargo-*` binary accepts or
forwards the injected subcommand token is changed, update all of the following
in the same change:

- `docs/design.md` §4.17 and [ADR-004](adr-004-cargo-external-subcommand-entry-point.md).
- `docs/roadmap.md` if the work remains tracked there.
- Any user-facing guide or README that shows `cargo <name>` or
  `cargo-<name> <name>` invocation.
- Regression coverage for both `cargo <name> [OPTIONS]` and
  `cargo-<name> <name> [OPTIONS]` once the repository adds or revises those
  tests.

## Schema ownership

Documentation IR, agent context, and policy reports have separate owners. See
[ADR-003](adr-003-define-schema-ownership-for-agent-native-contracts.md) for
the accepted decision.

Add localized human-documentation fields to `ortho_config::docs` only when
they are required by generated documentation, localization, roff, PowerShell
help, or other human-facing reference material. Those fields are versioned by
`ORTHO_DOCS_IR_VERSION` and exposed through `OrthoConfigDocs`.

Add compact agent invocation fields to `ortho_config::agent_context` when
downstream applications need a reusable machine-readable command contract. Use
`ORTHO_AGENT_CONTEXT_SCHEMA_VERSION` for compatibility. Do not add Fluent
message identifiers, localized long prose, or renderer-specific output
structures to the agent-context schema.

Add agent-native warning and hard-failure report fields to
`cargo_orthohelp::policy` while `cargo-orthohelp` is the only emitter. Use
`ORTHO_POLICY_REPORT_SCHEMA_VERSION` for compatibility and keep rule
identifiers, finding codes, severities, and source locations machine-stable.
Extract the report model into `ortho_config` only after a new ADR approves
shared ownership.

Use `rstest` for schema unit tests. Add `rstest-bdd` behavioural scenarios and
end-to-end tests when a change affects observable CLI behaviour, generated
artefacts, persisted output, integration contracts, stdout, stderr, or exit
codes. Do not add Kani, Verus, or property-test tooling unless the change
introduces a substantive invariant across a range of inputs, states, orderings,
or transitions.

Run `coderabbit review --agent` after major milestones that change schemas,
documentation contracts, or externally visible behaviour. Clear its concerns
before moving to the next milestone.

## Agent-native architecture boundary

Agent-native CLI assistance is contract modelling work inside OrthoConfig, not
a transfer of downstream application execution into this repository. The
canonical contract and boundary document is
[Agent-native CLI assistance design](agent-native-cli-design.md).

Contributors should keep reusable command-contract policy in OrthoConfig:

- command, option, output, and workflow metadata;
- documentation IR, agent-context schema, and related versioning policy;
- generated human documentation and compact agent-facing context;
- vocabulary, structured-output, and bounded-list lint policy; and
- optional shared primitives for profiles, delivery targets, feedback stores,
  skill manifests, and execution-ledger metadata.

Downstream applications own the execution side of those contracts. Weaver,
Netsuke, or another consumer remains responsible for command execution, domain
side effects, sandboxing, safety policy, long-running job semantics, provider
routing, build graph behaviour, and application-specific persistence. If
OrthoConfig executes downstream commands or owns downstream side effects, stop
and revisit the boundary in the agent-native design.

## Behavioural test layout

Behavioural suites live in crate-local integration test targets:

- `ortho_config/tests/rstest_bdd/`
- `examples/hello_world/tests/rstest_bdd/`

Feature files are in:

- `ortho_config/tests/features/`
- `examples/hello_world/tests/features/`

Step definitions use `rstest-bdd` macros (`#[given]`, `#[when]`, `#[then]`) and
consume `rstest` fixtures. Scenario-local mutable state is modelled with
fixtures and `Slot<T>` values inside `#[derive(ScenarioState)]` structs.
Cross-scenario mutable sharing is forbidden; use `#[once]` only for expensive,
effectively read-only infrastructure.

## `rstest-bdd` v0.5.0 migration strategy

Status: adopted. See `docs/execplans/adopt-rstest-bdd-v0-5-0.md` for execution
history and rationale.

Migration guidance for contributors:

- Upgrade workspace pins to `rstest-bdd = "0.5.0"` and
  `rstest-bdd-macros = "0.5.0"`.
- Scenario functions must return `()` or explicit unit results
  (`Result<(), E>` / `rstest_bdd::StepResult<(), E>`). Avoid return type
  aliases in scenario signatures.
- Prefer `scenarios!(..., fixtures = [...], tags = ...)` for large feature
  bindings to reduce handwritten wrapper boilerplate.
- Prefer descriptive placeholder names over generic `{string}` placeholders so
  step signatures remain explicit and compile-time checked.
- Prefer underscore-prefixed fixture names only when no step resolves that
  fixture by name.
- Remove file-wide lint suppressions used only for historical generated-fixture
  warnings; retain only narrow, item-level `#[expect(...)]` annotations when
  still required.
- Keep scenario isolation as the default and reserve `#[once]` for shared
  infrastructure only.
- If a sync step needs async bridging, use
  `rstest_bdd::async_step::sync_to_async`.
- Keep tag names filter-friendly (`@name_part` style). Avoid dots in tag names
  used with `tags = "..."` expressions.

## Adding or changing behavioural tests

When adding scenarios or steps:

1. Add or edit the `.feature` file first.
2. Implement or update step definitions under the matching `tests/rstest_bdd`
   module.
3. Bind scenarios using `scenarios!` where possible; use explicit `#[scenario]`
   only when a feature needs bespoke fixtures or per-scenario control.
4. Keep assertions user-observable (`Then` steps) and avoid asserting private
   internals unless the behaviour cannot be observed externally.
5. Run the full required quality gates before finalising.

## Observability

OrthoConfig and `cargo-orthohelp` follow a single observability convention so
that downstream applications can attach the subscribers and exporters they
prefer without contending with this workspace for global state.

- Use the `tracing` crate for all diagnostic output. Prefer structured
  `tracing::{trace, debug, info, warn, error}` events and spans over
  `println!`, `eprintln!`, or direct `log` macros. Attach fields for
  identifiers, state, and error context so subscribers can filter and
  correlate events without parsing message text.
- Wrap meaningful units of work in spans. Use `#[tracing::instrument]` or
  explicit spans around request handling, command execution, retries, and
  background jobs. Do not hold a `Span::enter()` guard across `.await`; use
  `Instrument::instrument` or scoped synchronous spans instead.
- Use the `metrics` crate where usage, uptake, failure, or mitigation metrics
  are required. Choose `counter!` for cumulative events, `gauge!` for values
  that rise and fall, and `histogram!` for distributions such as latency or
  payload size.
- Describe emitted metrics with `describe_counter!`, `describe_gauge!`, or
  `describe_histogram!` whenever the unit or purpose is not obvious from the
  metric name. Keep metric names stable and labels low-cardinality. Do not put
  user input, request identifiers, unbounded path parameters, or raw error
  strings into labels.
- Respect the library and application boundary. Libraries in this workspace,
  including `ortho_config` and `cargo-orthohelp`'s reusable modules, may emit
  `tracing` events and `metrics` instrumentation, but must not install global
  subscribers or recorders. Applications and binaries should initialize their
  chosen exporters and subscribers once, as early as practical in startup.

Use `tracing` and `metrics` together where it aids diagnosis: spans give the
contextual envelope, events describe what happened inside, and metrics
aggregate the same activity for monitoring. New observability primitives, such
as additional metric families or span fields used across crates, should be
mentioned in the relevant design or component architecture document, so the
contract stays discoverable.

## Dependency management

Cargo dependencies in this workspace follow strict version pinning rules so
that builds remain stable and reproducible across contributors and continuous
integration (CI) environments.

- Use SemVer-compatible caret requirements for every dependency declared in
  `Cargo.toml`, for example, `some-crate = "1.2.3"`. This is Cargo's default
  and accepts non-breaking minor and patch updates while rejecting breaking
  changes from a new major version.
- Do not use wildcard (`*`) or open-ended inequality (`>=`) version
  requirements. They admit unpredictable upstream changes into the build and
  are forbidden in this workspace.
- Reserve tilde (`~`) requirements for the narrow case where a dependency must
  be locked to patch-level updates for a specific, documented reason. Record
  the rationale alongside the dependency entry or in the related design
  document, so a later reader can re-evaluate the constraint.
- Keep dependencies current. When upgrading a crate, run the full quality
  gates (`make check-fmt`, `make lint`, `make test`) and, where the upgrade
  changes behaviour or public API, update the relevant design document, ADR,
  or migration guide.
- Capture substantive dependency choices, such as adopting or replacing a
  crate, in an ADR following the documentation style guide. Reference the ADR
  from the design document and from this guide where future contributors
  should be aware of the decision.

## Command checklist

Run from repository root:

```bash
set -o pipefail; make check-fmt 2>&1 | tee /tmp/make-check-fmt.log
set -o pipefail; make lint 2>&1 | tee /tmp/make-lint.log
set -o pipefail; make test 2>&1 | tee /tmp/make-test.log
```

For targeted behavioural debugging:

```bash
cargo test -p ortho_config --tests
cargo test -p hello_world --tests --all-features
```
