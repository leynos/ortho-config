# Hello World example

This crate will showcase a minimal, end-to-end, configuration-driven
command-line application. It focuses on demonstrating the orthogonal
configuration concepts that power the wider project without adding
production-ready complexity.

## Demonstrated capabilities

- **Global parameters (switches and arrays)**: illustrate how the command-line
  parser exposes top-level configuration that applies to every command,
  covering boolean feature switches, repeated values, and precedence between
  defaults and caller-supplied input.
- **Collection merge strategies**: demonstrate vector appends alongside map
  replacement semantics. The `greeting_templates` field in `GlobalArgs` uses
  the `merge_strategy = "replace"` attribute, so configuration files can swap
  the entire template set without leaking defaults from other layers. This
  keeps the example defaults isolated when consumers override templates.
- **Subcommands**: implement a friendly `greet` command that accepts a name and
  configurable greeting, alongside a `take-leave` workflow that combines
  switches, optional arguments, and shared greeting customizations to decide
  how a farewell is delivered.
- **Testing disciplines**: add `rstest`-powered unit tests for deterministic
  components and `cucumber-rs` behavioural specifications that exercise the
  binary as a user would, capturing configuration precedence and cross-platform
  quirks. The unit suite now includes a declarative merging fixture that
  enumerates precedence permutations. This pairs with the cucumber JSON-layer
  scenario.
- **Declarative merging**: demonstrate how `MergeComposer` and
  `merge_from_layers` build layered configuration without invoking the CLI by
  driving a behavioural scenario that composes JSON-described layers into
  `GlobalArgs`, asserting that default salutations are preserved when
  environment layers append new values.
- **Shell and Windows automation**: provide paired `.sh` and `.cmd` scripts
  highlighting how environment variables, configuration files, and command-line
  overrides interact. Include examples covering default configuration,
  per-subcommand overrides, and the precedence order across the sources.
- **YAML 1.2 parsing**: exercise the new `serde-saphyr` provider with
  behavioural coverage that keeps unquoted scalars such as `yes` as strings via
  strict boolean parsing and rejects duplicate mapping keys, mirroring the
  semantics library users observe.

## Planned project layout

- `src/` will contain a small `main.rs` and supporting modules for
  option-parsing, command dispatch, and domain logic.
- `tests/` will host Cucumber steps and supporting fixtures for behavioural
  coverage.
- `scripts/` will offer automation snippets, with mirrored POSIX shell and
  Windows `.cmd` scripts to showcase configuration strategies on each platform.
- `config/` will collect sample configuration files that the scripts reference
  during demonstrations.

## Implementation considerations

- Keep the greeting and farewell flows intentionally simple so that the focus
  remains on configuration handling rather than application behaviour.
- Ensure every configuration source is represented in both documentation and
  automated coverage to demonstrate reproducibility.
- Document how to run the example from a fresh checkout through the scripts and
  behavioural tests.

## Configuration samples and scripts

The `config/` directory contains `baseline.toml` and `overrides.toml`. The
baseline file defines the defaults exercised by the behavioural tests and the
demo scripts. `overrides.toml` extends the baseline to demonstrate
configuration inheritance by changing the recipient and salutation while
preserving the original repository state.

When present, `.hello_world.toml` overrides both global excitement and nested
`cmds.greet` fields. Discovery prefers `HELLO_WORLD_CONFIG_PATH`, then standard
user configuration folders (`$XDG_CONFIG_HOME`, entries in `$XDG_CONFIG_DIRS`,
and `%APPDATA%`), and finally falls back to `$HOME/.hello_world.toml` and the
working directory. The shipped overrides enable a `Layered hello` preamble and
triple exclamation marks, so the behavioural suite and demo scripts assert the
shouted output (`HEY CONFIG FRIENDS, EXCITED CREW!!!`) to guard the layering.
The derive uses `#[ortho_config(prefix = "HELLO_WORLD")]`; the macro appends
the trailing underscore automatically so environment variables continue to use
the `HELLO_WORLD_` prefix.

Once the workspace is built, `scripts/demo.sh` (or `scripts/demo.cmd` on
Windows) can be executed. Each script creates an isolated temporary directory,
copies the sample configuration files, and then invokes
`cargo run -p hello_world` multiple times to show the precedence order: file
defaults, environment overrides, and CLI flags. The scripts leave the
repository tree untouched so they are safe to rerun. The derived CLI also
exposes a `--config` / `-c` flag so ad hoc configuration files can be layered
without mutating the working directory.

## Getting started

- Prerequisites: Rust toolchain (via rustup), Cargo, make, and
  markdownlint-cli2.
- Build: `cargo build`.
- Run formatting and Markdown lint checks: `make fmt && make markdownlint`.
- Validate Mermaid diagrams (if present): `make nixie`.
- Run static analysis: `cargo clippy -D warnings` (or `make lint`).
- Execute tests (unit and behavioural): `make test`.

## Implementation checklist

- [x] Scaffold the crate with `Cargo.toml`, `src/main.rs`, and supporting
      modules.
- [x] Define global command-line parameters, switches, and array parameters
      with defaults and validation.
- [x] Implement the `greet` subcommand with its arguments and options.
- [x] Implement the `take-leave` subcommand with its arguments and options.
- [x] Add `rstest` unit tests covering parsing, validation, and command logic.
- [x] Add `cucumber-rs` behavioural tests covering end-to-end workflows and
      configuration precedence.
- [x] Create shell and Windows `.cmd` scripts showcasing configuration file
      usage and overrides.
- [x] Provide sample configuration files aligned with the scripts and tests.
- [x] Update documentation to reference the example and describe how to run it.
